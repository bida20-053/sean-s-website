        <p1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">THE HISTORY OF STUTTGART</p1>
            <h1>The city of Stuttgart is a relatively young city in Europe, there are records that confirm that its beginnings date from 950 AD. Previously it is known that it was the Romans who occupied the region although the human settlements of the Roman era were closer to the river Neckar, in the Cannstatt region.<br><br>

            It was during the 950s after Christ that it is known that the region of Stuttgart was occupied for the breeding of horses owned by Luis Dolf of Swabia, who was the son of Otto El Primero, King of the Saxons, which sent his son to open the breeding of horses because they needed to strengthen their army, and the Stuttgart region for being a valley between mountains had a perfect topography for raising animals. Soon there are not many records of that time, only that the name Stuttgart comes from that time, Stutten garten that meant garden of mares.<br><br>

            It was not until the 1920s that the so-called Conrad of Wurttemberg married to Luit Gardt built his own castle in the region, it is presumed that during the stables there was the main house of the farm or farm, and it was that building that was taken by Conrad to build the castle which would be his and his wife's room. In the same way, there are not many records of that time.<br><br>
            
            It is until the year 1229 after Christ that it is handwritten by Pope Gregory that the region known as Stutten Garten was owned by the monks of Bebenhausen, at that time was Ulrich 1 house with Methgil of Baden.<br><br>
                
            It is in the year of 1246 the great battle of Nida, in Europe there was already a little development and private property was respected, this battle was to determine who would be the King of the region, on the one hand were the Wurttemberger allied with the Staufer , against Henrich Raspe who pretended to be the King. During this battle the Wurttemberger flag betrayers betrayed their allies, leaving the Staufer alone and thus losing the battle and extinguishing their name completely, finally sealing the new alliance between the Wurttembergers and Henrich Raspe.
            In the following years, the Wurttembergers were building the water channels around the Castle, which were also using their facilities, and many street sales were growing around creating a rather primitive market.<br><br>
            It was in the year 1286 AD. The son of Ulrich I, called Evergarth I, had the first seal of the city with a horse and a horse. the same symbol that is used until today.
            In the year of 1311, for war reasons Evergarth 1st leaves the city for the moment leaving for Besicaith, so Stuttgart becomes part of Essinger.
            In the year of 1321 the church becomes a collegiate since Evergarth brings the remains of his ancestors<br><br>

            Then already by the years of 1393 AD. The castle was bigger and the marriages were growing, Antonia Visconti de Millan married Evergarth III "El Suave", but Antonia was accustomed to a better life, accustomed to more luxuries and more developed cities so the union did not have it completely satisfied, to try to keep her happy with the marriage, her own garden was built in the area that is currently Karls Platz.<br><br>
            During the year of 1441 the region of Wurttember is separated between two brothers, a part for Ulrich V, which obtains Wuttember Stuttgart and Ludwig that obtains Wuttember Ulrach, Ulrich V "the loved one" was the one that brings the Dominican monks, the city began to develop and grow, during that time a town was built on the outskirts of the city wall.<br><br>

            Count Evergarth V "The Bearded One" reunites the lands again, becoming a very popular person, so that the day of the emperor in Worms is named Duke Evergarth I.
            In the year 1498 was the time of Duke Ulrich, which in the year of 1519 after a scandal in which Ulrich, in love with the wife of one of his subjects, ends up murdering him in a stable, but this action was not well judged and he was forced to flee towards Mompelgard, which was part of his lands in France. With the escape of the Duke, the land passes into possession of Habpsburer, during this time it is noted that by order of Habpsburer the cemeteries were removed from the city, since it was not their will to keep them around the church.<br><br>
             It was not until 1534 that the cousin of Duke Ulrich, Filip de Hesseng who helped Ulrich to recover again Wurttemberg, for it Fillip demanded Duke Ulrich to be transformed into the Protestant religion. For the recovery of Wurttemberg took the battle of Laufen which Fillip came out victorious, And it is until May 13 the return of Ulrich which entered the city through the door of Rothbildtur. three days later the Condard Utinger celebrates the first evangelical mass.<br><br>

            Duke Christoph son of Ulrich in the year 1550, being a great evangelical fan with his friend Johanes Brentz, who was a great reformer together with Martin Luther, makes a reform of the laws, and it is in the year of 1559 which I forced by law that all children as girls attend school, a quite innovative law for that time, as Baden for example I take back that law until the year 1810, more than 200 years later.
            Duke Christoph makes the castle change to a Renaissance style, inspired by Neuburg near the Danube river. The Chapel inside the castle was designed in an evangelical way with a pedestal in the middle of the church, being one of the first churches in Germany with those characteristics.</h1><br><br><br><br>
