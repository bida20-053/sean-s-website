The festival takes place on the traditional fairgrounds of Cannstatter Wasen (Bad Cannstatt). It is slightly smaller than the Volksfest, in autumn, but it is the largest spring festival in Europe.

            <td>The Afrika Festival debuted in 2003, on the 2nd weekend in July. Since then, it has attracted thousands of visitors, local and from abroad, to the Heslach District of Stuttgart. The festival is a meeting place for people of all nations; an ideal place to make new contacts or renew old friendships and enjoy colourful merchandise (seriously you will want to buy it all). It has been one of my absolute favourite events this year.</td>

            <td>The Summer Festival of Cultures takes place every July, in Marktplatz, Stuttgart. The big street festival is a place where you can encounter enthusiastic people of all nationalities, races and ages.

            The festival is a crowd-puller for the most diverse people and cultural groups. Stars of the international World Music scene offer an exciting mix of concerts. Go for the culinary delights from around the world and the other cultural programs provided by the Stuttgart immigrant associations.</td>

This year was the 13th edition, and the participating countries were Italy, the Philippines, and Brazil. For a weekend, each country has 20 minutes in the evening, to mesmerize the jury with their firework display, to the rhythm of the music.  Like any other festival, there is food and rides for the little ones.</td>
