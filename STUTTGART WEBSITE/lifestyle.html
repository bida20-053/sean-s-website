            <p>Ready to get your party on in Germany soon? While Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich typically get all the love — er, the most visitors — may we humbly present an alternative option for your travels: Stuttgart, Germany.

            Never been there? Don’t write off Stuttgart, Germany so fast: the capital city of the state of Baden-Württemberg can truly hold its own. Here are five things you probably didn’t know about Germany’s sixth largest city.</p>

            <p>If you’re a Thirsty Swagman fan, we’re guessing you love beer as much as we do. So you’ll be pretty pumped to hear that Stuttgart is home to Europe’s second largest beer festival, right after — you guessed it — Oktoberfest in Munich.

            First held in 1818 as a harvest thanksgiving celebration, the Stuttgart Beer Festival (also referred to locally as Cannstatter Volksfest) attracts over 4 million people per year. It’s three weeks of carnival rides, live bands, and beer guzzling in seven beer tents for your festival-going pleasure.

            This year’s festival takes place from September 28 – October 14, meaning it starts a week after Oktoberfest. If you’re extra thirsty and ambitious, why not hit up both? #Beergoals, am I right? If you can’t make the Stuttgart Beer Festival in the fall, however, fear not: there’s actually a Spring Beer Festival that’s a little bit smaller, too. Prost!

            <p>If you love cars, you’ll be in heaven in Stuttgart, Germany: the automobile and motorcycle were allegedly invented in this German city.

            It’s no wonder that Stuttgart is sometimes referred to as the “cradle of the automobile”; famous names like Porsche and Mercedes-Benz are headquartered here, and you can even visit entire museums dedicated to these cars and their history. (The Mercedes-Benz Museum, in fact, is the most visited museum in Stuttgart, receiving 440,000 visits per year. We’re guessing nearly all of those visitors took the time to gaze at the legit Popemobile that Pope John Paul II used.)

            Can’t get enough of your automotive desires? Why not stay at Stuttgart’s V8 Hotel, where its themed rooms (think British Racing, Route 66, or Drive In Cinema) will carry your car-laden dreams from day to night.</p>

            <p>Schweine Museum Stuttgart, also called the Pig Museum, is a quirky museum located in an old slaughterhouse. With 29 themed rooms and over 50,000 different pig artifacts, there’s bound to be something for everyone — whether you like bacon for breakfast or have a stuffed animal of Piglet from Winnie the Pooh in your childhood bedroom. Don’t miss the Piggy Bank Room and the “naughty” red room  — or, if you just want some grub, head straight to the café and restaurant for some pork knuckles and delicious beer. Just be sure to not hog all of that tasty food from your travel companions!</p>
